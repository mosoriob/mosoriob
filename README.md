# Hi, I'm Maximiliano 

Experienced Software Engineer and FullStack Developer with a strong background in building scalable web platforms and optimizing complex systems for high-performance applications. I have over 8 years of experience leading and contributing to innovative projects, including MINT – a decision-making platform for climate and resource analysis used by DARPA. I’m also the founder of Actify, a web platform designed to connect people with sports and leisure activities, leveraging the power of AWS services like GraphQL, Lambda, and Cognito for an optimized user experience.

Key Achievements:

Architected and managed a microservices infrastructure for MINT, processing over 22 million simulations to support decision-making in climate and resource management.
Implemented scalable DevOps practices (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD with GitHub Actions), reducing deployment time by 80%.
Developed open-source tools, including OBA, a Java-based framework for generating REST APIs from ontologies, recognized as Best Work at ISWC.
