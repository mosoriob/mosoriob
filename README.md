# Hi, I'm Maximiliano 

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making AI researchers possible and creating technologies to integrate information and models across disciplines.

I enjoy:

- Designing architecture and implementing backend services using different languages (Go, Python, Nodejs, or Java).
- And creating good software for the community :heart:.

I recently started to learn about Mobile development using Expo.

I actively contribute to the following organizations:

- [Knowledge Capture and Discovery](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery)
- [MINT Project](https://github.com/mintproject/mint)
- [In-For-Disaster Analytics](https://github.com/In-For-Disaster-Analytics)
